The Modelling Agent Model
=======

Agent
-----
An Agent exists inside an Environment.
The Agent can not read or manipulate this Environment directly.
However, the Agent can sense the Environment through their Senses, giving them a reduced Image of it.
Furthermore, the Agent can interact with the Environment through Actions, which transform the Environment.
Through a feedback loop of sensing and acting, the Agent pursues their Goals.
What mechanism stands between an Agent's Senses, Goals and Actions, is the Agent's Decider.

Hard-Wired Agent
-----
Perhaps the simplest possible non-trivial Agent, is one that, for any given Image of the world, executes a fixed predetermined Action.
The Agent's success or failure in achieving their goals is determined by the Decider they come into existence with and the Environment they find themselves in.

Soft-Wired Agent
-----
While still having a fixed Action for a given Image of the Environment, an Agent could have a mechanism for evaluating how it's Actions serve towards achieving it's Goals, which instruct an adaption of it's Decider.

Modelling Agent
-----
With an Agent's inability to directly read the Environment, instead of taking the Image they take of it directly in determining their Actions, an Agent could attempt to construct a Model of the Environment, instructed by their Image of it.
In having a Model of the Environment, the Agent's Actions are no longer directly restricted by their Senses, but merely the Model's accuracy is determined by the Agent's capacity and the representativeness of the Image they have of the Environment.
In having a representation of the Environment that the Agent can directly read and manipulate, the Agent is capable of taking Actions as if they were capable to reading the Environment itself.
An innacurate direct Model of the Environment is stronger than an accurate indirect Image of the Environment in deciding Actions.
